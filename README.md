# Prodigy InfoTech Internship : TASK 5: 

🚗 Road Accident Data Analysis and Visualization

🚀 Project Overview :

This project delves into road accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and accident hotspots 🌧️🚧. The primary goal is to provide valuable insights into factors contributing to road accidents and identify high-risk areas for better safety interventions.

🎯 Key Objectives :

🔍 Pattern Identification: Explore how different factors like road conditions, weather, and time of day impact accident occurrences.

🗺️ Accident Hotspot Visualization: Map areas with frequent accidents to identify hotspots.

📊 Contributing Factors Analysis: Examine factors such as junction control, road surface conditions, and vehicle types to understand their influence on accident severity.

📂 Dataset :

The dataset includes the following features:

🚦 Junction_Control: The type of control at the junction (e.g., "give way," uncontrolled).

🚨 Accident_Severity: The severity of the accident (e.g., Slight, Serious).

📍 Latitude: The geographical location of the accident.

🌞 Light_Conditions: The lighting conditions at the time of the accident.

🛤️ Road_Surface_Conditions: Whether the road was dry, wet, or icy.

🌦️ Weather_Conditions: The weather conditions during the accident.

🚑 Number_of_Casualties: The number of people injured or killed.

🛣️ Road_Type: The type of road (e.g., Single carriageway).

🚗 Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicle involved in the accident.

🛠️ Analysis Process :

🧹 Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is clean and ready for analysis by handling missing values and standardizing formats.

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the basic distributions and trends in the dataset.

📊 Pattern Identification:

Analyze how road conditions and weather affect accident frequency and severity.

Examine the relationship between junction control and accident outcomes.

🗺️ Hotspot Visualization : 
  Create maps to visualize accident hotspots using latitude and location data.
  
🔑 Contributing Factors : 
  Analyze factors such as junction control, road surface conditions, and vehicle types to identify their impact on accident severity.
  
🛠️ Tools and Libraries :

🐍 Python: For data processing and analysis.

📊 Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

📉 Matplotlib / Seaborn: For creating static visualizations.

🌍 Folium: For interactive maps to visualize accident hotspots.

📊 Visualizations :

🗺️ Geospatial Maps : Displaying accident hotspots based on latitude and location data.

📊 Bar Charts : Showing the distribution of accidents by road surface conditions, weather, and junction control.

🥧 Pie Charts : Illustrating the proportions of accidents based on factors like severity, weather conditions, and road types.

🔵 Scatter Plots: Analyzing the relationship between accident severity and contributing factors like vehicle type and light conditions.

📌 Insights and Findings :

🚨 Accident Severity: 85.5% of accidents are classified as slight, indicating minor injuries are most common.

🛑 Junction Control: Most accidents occur at "give way" or uncontrolled junctions, highlighting a need for better control measures.

🚗 Number of Casualties by Vehicle Type: Vehicle type 1 is associated with the highest number of casualties, totaling 48, with these incidents being classified as fatal. This underscores a critical area for safety interventions.

📉 Speed Limits: Many accidents happen in areas with a 30 mph speed limit, suggesting a need to review speed limit enforcement.

📅 Day of the Week: Fridays have the highest number of accidents and casualties, accounting for 16.4% of the total.

🌤️ Weather Conditions: Most accidents occur in clear weather with no high winds, indicating other factors may be more significant.

🛤️ Road Surface Conditions: Dry roads are involved in the majority of accidents, emphasizing the need for broader safety measures.

🚗 Vehicle Type: Cars are involved in the majority of accidents, with 239,793 incidents recorded.

🌞 Light Conditions: Daylight hours see the most accidents, with 227,285 incidents.

🛣️ Road Type: Single carriageways are the most common location for accidents.

🕔 Time of Day: The peak time for accidents is 17:00, possibly due to increased traffic or driver fatigue.
